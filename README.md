# Java-Projects

This repository contains work that I've done in my Object-Oriented Programming Class at Purdue University. It will contain projects done on my own and collaboratively. I'd like to especially highlight Project 5, which is a project I worked on collaboratively with a team to create an online storefront using server-client architecture.
